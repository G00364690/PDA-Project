## Instructions
In order to complete this assigment it was necessary to:
1. Download & install Anaconda
2. Download & install Console Emulator x64
3. Create directory and files such as this README, LICENSE and .gitignore using Linux commands
4. Launch a jupyter notebook from the command line and create PDA-Project.ipynb
5. Download the Anscombe Quartet dataset and read the dataset into PDA-Project.ipynb and perform analysis
6. Sync files on my local machine to repository on GitHub allow me to push/pull updates to the jupyter notebook over various commits

To review the analysis methods and conclusions from the assigment:
1. Simply launch the Jupyter Notebook entitled "PDA-Project.ipynb"
2. Review the full analysis in the Jupyter Notebook
3. Run individual elements of the python code by highlighting cells and using command SHIFT+ENTER

## Plan the project
The approach to this project has been to:

1. Decide on the real life phenomenon to simulate
2. Investigate the variables driving the phenomenon and simplify the problem to most dominant variables
3. Investigate dominant variables and determine their average value ranges and distributions
4. Write some python code to display the data
5. Simulate the phenomenon and with sythesized data
